Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
The purpose of a breakpoint is to have the execution of the code stop at that particular line in order to conduct further inspection for debugging.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, the line of code on the breakpoint does not run when you start debugging.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
We click on the "Step over" command in the debugging console and then we can inspect the next line of code.

4. What does the step into command do?
The "step into" command allows us to step into a function being called in the line being debugged so that we can inspect how the function is running.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluating an expression is when you can run one line of Java code with the objects/data available to the debugger console in order to determine its value, but with evaluating code fragments, we can run multiple lines of Java code with the objects/data available in order to determine
